# Red Hat Edge Manager Demo

A comprehensive demo showcasing Red Hat Edge Manager (RHEM) capabilities for managing edge devices at scale. RHEM is product based on upstream [FlightCtl project](https://github.com/flightctl/flightctl).

## What You'll Learn

- Zero-touch device onboarding at scale
- Image-based immutable operating systems with bootc RHEL
- Declarative application and configuration management
- Fleet management with templated configurations  
- Built-in observability and remote troubleshooting
- Secure pull-mode device communication

**Demo Duration:** ~50 minutes

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and Configure**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luisarizmendi/rhem-demo
   cd rhem-demo
   ```

2. **Set up GitHub Actions** - See [Setup Guide](docs/01-setup.md)

3. **Deploy RHEM** - Follow [RHEM Deployment](docs/02-rhem-deployment.md)

4. **Prepare Demo Environment** - See [Demo Preparation](docs/03-demo-preparation.md)

5. **Run the Demo** - Follow [Demo Script](docs/04-demo-script.md)

- [ðŸ“Š Slide Deck example](docs/LA%20-%20RHEM%20technical%20capabilities%20overview.pdf) - Presentation example

## Image Building

This repo uses GitHub Actions to automatically build:
- **Bootc device images** (`devices/` changes â†’ `ghcr.io/owner/device-demo-*`)
- **Application images** (`apps/` changes â†’ `ghcr.io/owner/app-demo-*`)

Images are built for x86_64 and ARM64 with automatic versioning.

If you want to check other examples you can get some ideas from [`bootc-build-scenarios`](https://github.com/luisarizmendi/bootc-build-scenarios) repo.


## Support & Feedback

This demo uses a standalone RHEM deployment for simplicity. Production deployments follow different patterns.At this moment, for production deployments, RHEM is available through:
- Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform
- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management
